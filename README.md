# A k apart.

<a href="https://a-k-apart.com" aria-label="go to the a-k-apart website">a-k-apart</a>, a contest on the internet for creating an awesome website in 10kB. This we can do i thought, so i did. What would we like to start with.

My first thought was to create a menu, a hamburger menu. Without javascript. That is ridiculous.

# css + selector
The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element_pluss.asp">css + selector</a>, cool. We can animate the menu. Add a checkbox and add a <code>input:checked + nav</code> on it. It shows in a custom selector when the checkbox is checked. Lets animate. Transitions, move the menu to the left when it is not shown. Add a <code>transition: .5s left, .5s background;</code> on the basterd and move it back on the screen. Put it on the header and make the header funky. Rotate that thing.

# Some basic styling
Ok so we got this. Fonts, i don't know fonts. I know this guy named <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>, they know fonts. Check, copied and pasted. I like those new default fonts.

Lets go add some colors. Déjà vu, i don't know colors. I know this lad <a href="https://flatuicolors.com/">flatuicolors</a>, they know colors. Cool.

# Jekyll, lets go

Let's build some stuff. I know this dude <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> who knows building, it adds a sass compiler out of the box. Also friend of his <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> build those pages when it sees a <code>gh-pages</code> branch and launches it on the internet.

So a long story less long is created. Let's make an awesome page for this contest.
